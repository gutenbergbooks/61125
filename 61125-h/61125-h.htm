<h2 class="no-brk lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<span class="lsp2">THE INFANTRY.</span></h2>

<p class="p2" />

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand-grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em> King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities,&mdash;united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are well suited to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p class="noindent">The advances made by King James II. towards the
subversion of the laws, and the established religion of
the kingdom, occasioned the Prince of Orange to be
invited to come to England with an army, to enable the
nobility and other persons of property and influence to
assert the inviolable character of the Constitution in parliament.
The Prince landed in Devonshire on the 5th of
November, 1688, and a number of persons afterwards
joining his standard, they were formed into companies
of musketeers and pikemen, and three regiments were
embodied under Colonels Lord Mordaunt, Sir John
Guise, and Sir Robert Peyton: troops of cavalry and
companies of infantry were also raised, in the interest of
the Prince of Orange, in various parts of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>The flight of King James to France was followed by
the elevation of the Prince and Princess of Orange to
the throne, in February, 1689. At this period several
of the companies of pikemen and musketeers raised
when the Prince of Orange landed, were incorporated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
into a regiment under Colonel Francis Lutterell, whose
commission, as colonel of this regiment, was dated the
28th of February, 1689; but the regiment, being formed
of companies raised about the middle of November,
1688, was permitted to take rank from that date, and
now bears the title of the "<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH REGIMENT OF
FOOT</span>."</p>

<p>The following officers were appointed to commissions
in the regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the summer of this year the regiment marched to
Portsmouth; it was afterwards stationed in the Isle of
Wight, and in September embarked on board the fleet
to serve as marines; but landed at Plymouth in the
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>The authority of King William being resisted in
Ireland, an army was sent to that country under Marshal
Duke Schomberg, and in March, 1690, the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
received orders to send five hundred and
twenty men to Ireland, to replace the losses sustained
by many regiments at the unhealthy camp of Dundalk.
The regiment afterwards sent a detachment to the West
Indies, where nearly all the men died. The regiment
also sustained the loss of its colonel, who died this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>In 1691 the regiment was stationed in England recruiting,
and the colonelcy was conferred on Colonel
Thomas Erle, from a regiment which was raised in
March, 1689, and disbanded after the treaty of Ryswick
in 1697.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>Having recruited its ranks and attained a state of
efficiency, the regiment embarked for Flanders in the
spring of 1692, and joined the confederate army, commanded
by the British monarch in person, whose efforts
were directed to arrest the progress of aggression pursued
by Louis XIV.;&mdash;it served the campaign of this
year against the French under Marshal Luxemburg.</p>

<p>At the battle of <em>Steenkirk</em>, on the 3rd of August, the
regiment was in the main body of the allied army, and
the advance-guard being repulsed before the supporting
columns arrived at the field of battle, King William ordered
a retreat. Colonel <span class="smcap">Erle</span>'s regiment was one of
the corps which did not sustain any loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment was one of the corps assembled
at Parck-camp, near Louvain, in May, 1693;
and by taking possession of this post, King William defeated
the designs of the French monarch on Brabant.
The fourteenth, sixteenth, <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>, and two newly-raised
regiments were formed in brigade under Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Erle. This brigade was in position at
<em>Landen</em>, on the 29th of July, when the confederate
army was attacked by the superior numbers of the
enemy. Brigadier-General Erle was ill of a fever, but
hearing that an action was likely to take place, he
quitted his bed, and was wounded at the head of his
brigade. The French having, by their numerical
strength, forced the position, the confederate army retreated.
Both armies sustained severe loss, and the
enemy derived little advantage from the victory, beyond
an opportunity to besiege Charleroi, which was
captured in the autumn.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment passed the winter in
quarters at Malines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>In the beginning of May, 1694, the regiment quitted
its quarters, and pitched its tents near the cloister of
Terbanck; it took part in the operations of the campaign,
and performed many long marches in Flanders
and Brabant, and in the autumn returned to the pleasant
town of Malines, where it passed another winter in
garrison, with the third and fourth regiments of foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>Early in the spring of 1695 the regiment marched to
the vicinity of Ghent, and was encamped near Marykirk
until the army took the field. King William undertook
the siege of the strong fortress of <em>Namur</em>, and the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
formed part of the covering army under the
Prince of Vaudemont, who acquired great reputation
for the skilful retreat he effected in the presence of a
French army, of very superior numbers, under Marshal
Villeroy. After taking part in covering this retreat, the
regiment was employed in several operations for the
protection of the maritime and other towns of Flanders,
and to cover the troops carrying on the siege of Namur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which fortress was captured by the troops under King
William, and that event terminated the campaign. The
<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment passed the winter at Dendermond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>Finding the progress of his arms arrested, and the
fortune of war in favour of the confederates, the French
monarch contemplated detaching England from the
alliance against his interests, by replacing King James
on the throne, for which purpose preparations were
made for invading England, and a conspiracy was formed
in London for assassinating King William. In consequence
of the preparations in France, the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>,
and a number of other regiments, were ordered to return
to England. The regiment embarked from Sas-van-Ghent
in March, 1696, and sailed to Gravesend, where
it landed. The assassination plot was discovered, and
the designs of the French monarch frustrated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until the summer
of 1697, when it again proceeded to Flanders, and joined
the army encamped near Brussels on the 14th of July;
two days afterwards it was reviewed by King William.
The treaty of Ryswick was signed in September, and
the British monarch saw his efforts for the preservation
of liberty, and the balance of power in Europe, attended
with success. The regiment returned to England in
November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698<br />1702</div>

<p>In 1698 the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment was stationed in
Ireland, where it remained until 1702, when the succession
of the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV.,
to the throne of Spain had produced another war.</p>

<p>Early in 1702 an expedition against the port and city
of <em>Cadiz</em> was resolved upon by the British government,
and the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment was withdrawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Ireland to take part in the enterprise; the fleet was
commanded by Admiral Sir George Rooke, and the land
forces were placed under the orders of the Duke of Ormond.
The regiment proceeded to the Isle of Wight,
where it embarked on board the fleet,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which sailed for
Cadiz, and a landing was effected between Rota and Fort
St. Catherine in the middle of August. Fort St. Mary's
was taken possession of, and some advantages were
gained; but the expedition proved of insufficient force
for the reduction of Cadiz, and the troops re-embarked.
The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment was detached from Cadiz to
the West Indies with the squadron of the royal navy
under Commander Walker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>A powerful armament was prepared for the attack of
the French and Spanish settlements in the West Indies
in 1703, but this enterprise was afterwards laid aside.
An unsuccessful attempt was made on Guadaloupe in
March of this year, by a few men under Colonel Codrington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1704<br />1705</div>

<p>Having lost a number of men from the effects of the
climate, the regiment was withdrawn from the West
Indies, and was stationed in Ireland in 1704; in 1705
it embarked for England, and landed near Chester in
October.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1706</div>

<p>The regiment was employed on home service during
the years 1706, 1707, 1708, and 1709.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1709</div>

<p>In May, 1709, Lieut.-General Erle disposed of the
colonelcy of the regiment to the lieut.-colonel, George
Freke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>Early in the spring of 1710 the regiment embarked
for Flanders, to join the allied army in that country
under the celebrated <span class="smcap">John, Duke of Marlborough</span>;
it advanced up the country to the vicinity of Tournay,
and afterwards took part in the movements by which
the French lines were forced at <em>Pont-à-Vendin</em>.</p>

<p>When the siege of <em>Douay</em> was undertaken, the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
regiment was one of the corps selected to take
part in this service. Some severe fighting took place in
carrying on the attacks, and in storming the outworks,
in which the regiment was engaged, and sustained
severe loss. On the 25th of June the garrison beat a
parley, and afterwards surrendered the fortress.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment had three serjeants and
ninety-one rank and file killed at the siege of Douay;
and one major, two captains, eight subalterns, ten serjeants,
and one hundred and ninety-seven rank and file
wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment formed part of the covering army
during the siege of <em>Bethune</em>, which fortress surrendered
on the 29th of August. <em>Aire</em> and <em>St.-Venant</em> were
afterwards invested and taken, and the regiment
marched to Ghent, where it passed the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>Advancing up the country in the spring of 1711, the
regiment encamped a short time at Warde, where it
was joined by a fine body of recruits from England. It
took part in the operations by which the enemy's fortified
lines were passed at <em>Arleux</em> on the 5th of August,
and it was afterwards engaged in the siege of <em>Bouchain</em>,
which proved a difficult service; but every obstacle was
overcome by the skill and perseverance of the generals
and engineers, and the innate bravery of the soldiers,
who, on more than one occasion, fought up to their
waists in water. This fortress was surrendered on the
13th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>In the spring of 1712 the regiment quitted its winter
quarters. Before the army was assembled, Colonel
Freke was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment
by Major-General Richard Sutton, from a newly-raised
corps, which was afterwards disbanded.</p>

<p>The army in Flanders was this year commanded by
the Duke of Ormond, and advanced to the frontiers of
France; but negotiations for a treaty of peace having
commenced, a suspension of hostilities was proclaimed,
and the British troops retired to the vicinity of Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1713</div>

<p>During the year 1713 the regiment was stationed in
Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>The decease of Queen Anne took place on the 1st of
August, 1714, when the regiment was ordered to return
to England, and it was placed in garrison at Tilbury
fort, Landguard fort, and Hull, with a detachment at
Sheerness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>In August, 1715, the colonelcy of the regiment was
conferred on Lieut.-Colonel Grove, from the foot guards,
in succession to Major-General Sutton, who withdrew
from active service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1716<br />1722<br />1723</div>

<p>The regiment was employed on home service many
years; in 1722 it was encamped on Salisbury Plain,
where it was reviewed by King George I.; and in the
following year it marched to Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>In 1727 the regiment was held in readiness to assist
the Dutch in the expected war with the Emperor of
Germany; but no embarkation took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1729</div>

<p>Colonel Grove died on the 13th of October, 1729, and
King George II. restored Major-General Sutton to the
colonelcy of the regiment.</p>

<p>At this period the regiment was removed to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1735<br />1738</div>

<p>Major-General Sutton was promoted to the rank of
lieut.-general in 1735, and died in 1738, when the
colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on Colonel the
Honorable Charles Howard, from captain and lieut.-colonel
in the foot guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>In 1739 war was proclaimed against Spain, and the
<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment was withdrawn from Ireland, and
stationed in North Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742<br />1744</div>

<p>A British army proceeded to Flanders in 1742, to
support the interests of the House of Austria against
France and Bavaria; but the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> were employed
on home service until 1744, when they proceeded
to Flanders, and served the campaign of that year with
the army under Field-Marshal Wade. The regiment
was encamped some time on the banks of the Scheldt,
and afterwards advanced into the territory subject to
France, as far as Lisle; but no serious fighting took
place, and it passed the winter in quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>The regiment was called from its winter quarters in
April, 1745, and advanced with the army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, to
the relief of Tournay, which fortress was besieged by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
numerous French force, and on the approach of the
allied army the enemy took up a formidable position
near the village of <em>Fontenoy</em>. This position was attacked
on the 11th of May, and the gallant bearing of the
British infantry was conspicuous; by a determined
charge they broke the French lines and overthrew all
opposition at their point of attack; but the Dutch failed
in their attempts to capture the village of Fontenoy,
and the English were exposed to a destructive flank
fire which forced them to retreat. The attack was repeated,
and British valour and intrepidity triumphed
once more; but the Dutch again failed, and the English
battalions, which had broken the enemy's lines, were
exposed to so destructive a fire from batteries on both
flanks, that a retreat was ordered, and the army withdrew
from the field of battle to Aeth.</p>

<p>The regiment had Lieutenant Le Grand, Ensign
Gibson, and seventeen private soldiers killed; Major
Petitot, Captains Cochran and Douglas, Lieutenant
Coote, Ensigns Cheape, Martin, and Potterfield, one
serjeant, and sixty-nine rank and file wounded; thirteen
men missing.</p>

<p>The subsequent operations of the campaign were of a
defensive character, and the allied army was so much
inferior in numbers to the enemy, that it was unable to
prevent the capture of several fortified towns in the
Austrian Netherlands.</p>

<p>This year a rebellion broke out in Scotland, and
Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, gained
some advantages at the head of the Highland clans,
when several corps were ordered to return to England,
but the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> remained in the Netherlands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>Taking the field in the spring of 1746, the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was employed in various services; but the allied army,
being very inferior in numbers to the force which the
French monarch employed in the Netherlands, was
necessarily restricted in its operations.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October the allied army was formed
on the beautiful plain of Liege, and the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
regiment was stationed, with two other corps, in the village
of <em>Roucoux</em>. About noon the superior numbers of
the enemy under Marshal Saxe were seen advancing, and
about three in the afternoon a numerous body of infantry
and artillery attacked three villages, which were occupied
by eight battalions of British, Dutch, and Hessians.
The disparity of numbers was about one to six, yet the
allies stood their ground gallantly, and repulsed the
leading brigades of the enemy. New combatants rushed
forward, and the allies were again victorious; but they
were eventually forced to quit the villages. After defending
their post with great bravery for some time, the
<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>, and other corps in Roucoux, quitted the
village, and took post in a hollow way, where they defended
themselves until a retreat was ordered, when the
army withdrew to the vicinity of Maestricht.</p>

<p>One serjeant, one drummer, and thirty-three rank
and file of the regiment were killed on this occasion;
Lieutenant Cuthbert, Ensign M'Farlane, three serjeants,
and nineteen rank and file wounded; Captain
Leake, Lieutenant Campbell, and several private soldiers
taken prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>After passing the winter in cantonments in Holland,
the regiment took the field with the army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and
distinguished itself at the battle of <em>Val</em>, on the 2nd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
July in that year. The enemy attacked the village of
Val, which was occupied by the thirteenth, twenty-fifth,
and thirty-seventh regiments, and a battalion of Hanoverians,
who repulsed the attacks of their numerous opponents
some time, but were eventually forced to give
way. They were reinforced by the eighth, <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>,
and forty-eighth regiments, and a foreign corps, and
returning to the charge, recovered the village. The
fighting at this point was very severe; several French
brigades were nearly annihilated, and the village was lost
and won several times. During this protracted contest
the innate valour of the British troops was very conspicuous;
but the enemy at length succeeded in breaking
the line, and the army was ordered to retreat to Maestricht,
where it arrived on the same evening.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Williams, two serjeants, one drummer,
and thirty-two rank and file of the regiment were killed;
Major Petitot, Captain Masters, Lieutenants Goddard,
Brown, Martin, and Phillips, Ensigns Dobson and
Fuller, three serjeants, and one hundred and three rank
and file wounded; fifteen rank and file missing.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>The regiment again took the field in 1748. Preliminary
articles for a treaty of peace were signed at Aix-la-Chapelle,
and a suspension of hostilities took place.</p>

<p>In this year Major-General the Honorable Charles
Howard was removed to the third dragoon guards, and
was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment
by Colonel Lord George Beauclerk, from the
eighth marines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>The regiment returned to England during the winter
of 1748-9, and immediately proceeded to Gibraltar,
where it was stationed four years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, a warrant was issued by
authority of King George II., for establishing uniformity
in the clothing, standards, and colours of the several
regiments, by which the facing of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> was
directed to be <em>green</em>. The First, or the King's colour,
was directed to be the Great Union; the Second, or
Regimental colour, to be the colour of the facings of
the regiment, with the Union in the upper canton; in
the centre of the colour, the Rank of the regiment,
in gold Roman characters, within a wreath of roses
and thistles on the same stalk, surmounted by the
Crown.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1753<br />1755<br />1756</div>

<p>Having been relieved from garrison duty at Gibraltar,
in 1753, the regiment returned to England; in 1755 it
was stationed in Scotland; in 1756 it was again stationed
in England.</p>

<p>A dispute respecting the extent of the British dominions
in North America having occasioned another
war with France, the regiment was augmented to <em>two
battalions</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In 1758 the Second battalion was formed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, under the command of Colonel
Edward Sandford.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1759<br />1760</div>

<p>During the summer of 1759 the regiment was encamped
at Brentwood, and in 1760 at Barham Downs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>In 1761 the regiment was placed under the orders of
Major-General Hodgson, for the attack of one of the
French islands off the coast of Brittany, called <em>Belle-Isle</em>.
The expedition appeared before this place on the 7th of
April; but the whole island was found like one vast
fortress, the little which nature had left undone by rocks
and crags having been supplied by art; and the first
attempt on the 8th of April, to establish a post on the
island, failed. The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>, mustering eight hundred
men, under Lieut.-Colonel Robert Douglas,
evinced great gallantry on this occasion in the assault
of the enemy's entrenchments on the shore; the officers
and soldiers rushed to the attack with heroic bravery,
but were unable to ascend the steep acclivity; they attempted
to help one another up, under a heavy fire, but
failed, and were ordered to re-embark.</p>

<p>The regiment lost Lieutenant Dougal Stuart, three
serjeants, one drummer, and forty-seven rank and file
killed; Major Lumisden, one serjeant, one drummer,
and thirty-eight rank and file wounded; Lieutenants
Scrymsour, Forbes, and Nugent, one serjeant, and
eighty-nine rank and file prisoners, thirty of whom
were wounded.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made on the 22nd of April, when
Brigadier-General Lambert effected a landing on the
rocks near Point Lomaria: the difficulty of mounting
the precipice had made the enemy least attentive to
that part. Beauclerk's grenadiers (<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>), with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Captain Patterson of the regiment, gained the summit
before the enemy saw what was intended, who immediately
marched a body of three hundred men to
attack them; the grenadiers maintained their ground
till the remainder of Brigadier Lambert's troops got
up. Three brass field-pieces were taken, and some
wounded prisoners. Captain Patterson lost his arm, and
the other casualties were about thirty men killed. The
cannon was afterwards landed from the ships and dragged
up the rocks; the lines which covered the town of Palais
were captured; the siege of the citadel was carried on
with vigour, and the garrison surrendered on the 7th of
June. The conquest of the island was thus achieved,
and the officers and soldiers taken prisoners re-joined
their regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>Returning from Belle-Isle when the capture of that
island was completed, the regiment was stationed in
England in 1762.</p>

<p>The war was terminated in 1762 by the peace of
Fontainebleau, and the regiment again proceeded to
Gibraltar, at which fortress it was stationed during the
following eight years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>On the decease of Lieut.-General Lord George
Beauclerk, the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred
on Major-General David Graeme, from the forty-ninth
regiment, by commission dated the 25th of May, 1768.</p>

<p>On the 19th of December, 1768, a warrant was issued
by command of King George III. for regulating the
standards, colours, clothing, &amp;c., of the regiments of
cavalry and infantry, by which it was directed, that the
<em>facing</em> of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH REGIMENT OF FOOT</span> should
be <em>deep green</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1771</div>

<p>Early in the spring of 1771 the regiment was relieved
from duty at Gibraltar, and arrived in England in
May.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1773<br />1775</div>

<p>In 1773 the regiment was stationed in Scotland; and
in 1775 it embarked for Ireland, where it was quartered
upwards of five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>The American war commenced in the same year in
which the regiment embarked for Ireland, and was continued
with varied success. In 1781 the regiment was
ordered to proceed to South Carolina and Georgia, to
reinforce the British troops in those provinces; it embarked
from Ireland on the 17th of March, and arrived
in America in May; but the peculiar turn which the
circumstances of the war took shortly afterwards, prevented
the regiment having an opportunity of distinguishing
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>A letter, dated the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed to
the regiment His Majesty's pleasure that it should
be designated the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>, or the <span class="smcap">FIRST YORKSHIRE
NORTH RIDING REGIMENT</span>, in order that a connexion
between the corps and that part of the county of York
should be cultivated, with the view of promoting the
success of the recruiting service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783<br />1791</div>

<p>Hostilities terminated in 1782, and the regiment proceeded
to the Leeward Islands; in 1783 it was removed
to Jamaica, where it was stationed until 1791, when it
returned to England, and landed at Portsmouth in
June.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>The French revolution had commenced while the regiment
was at Jamaica, and in 1793 the King of France
was beheaded, and a republican government was established,
which was followed by war between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and France. The French Royalists of <em>La Vendée</em> and
<em>La Loire</em> took arms against the regicide government,
and solicited aid from England; the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment
embarked with the expedition under Major-General
the Earl of Moira, to aid the French Royalists,
who expected to be able to gain possession of a
sufficient portion of the coast for the English troops to
land; the expedition was held in suspense, the fleet
being driven about the Channel in stormy weather in the
winter of 1793-4.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>No opportunity of landing in France, and of joining the
Vendéeans, having occurred, the regiment disembarked
on the coast of Devonshire in January, 1794, and went
into quarters: the health of the men having suffered
from being long detained on board of the fleet.</p>

<p>After a few months' repose in quarters, the regiment
again embarked, and sailed with the troops under the
Earl of Moira for Ostend, which fortress was menaced
by a numerous French force. The regiment landed at
Ostend on the 26th of June. The Earl of Moira resolved
not to limit his services to the defence of Ostend,
but to attempt to effect a junction with the army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of York; and
after a tedious and difficult march in the face of a victorious
enemy of superior numbers, whose troops were
overrunning the country in all directions, the British
arrived at Alost, where they repulsed the attack of a
body of the enemy on the 6th of July, and joined
the Duke of York's army at Malines three days afterwards.</p>

<p>The allies did not bring into the field a force sufficiently
numerous to contend with the immense armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of France, and the consequence was a disastrous campaign,
and a retreat through Holland to Germany during
the frosts and snow-storms of an unusually severe winter;
and the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> shared, with other regiments, in
the sufferings occasioned by these operations. The regiment
was engaged under Major-General Lord Cathcart
in the attack of the enemy's post at <em>Tuyl</em> on the 30th of
December, when it had five men killed and wounded;
it also took part in several skirmishes, frequently crossing
rivers on the ice to engage the numerous forces of the
enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>In the early part of January, 1795, it was found necessary
to resume the retreat, and a series of retrograde
movements, through a country covered with snow and
ice, brought the army into Germany, where the soldiers
obtained a short repose, and afterwards embarked from
Bremen for England.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> landed from Germany in May, 1795,
and were stationed in England eleven months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>On the 28th of April, 1796, the regiment embarked
for the East Indies, and landed at Madras in the middle
of November following.</p>

<p>A short time previously to the arrival of the regiment
in India, the large and mountainous island of Ceylon,
situate in the Indian Sea, had been captured from the
Dutch, who had become united with France in hostility
to Great Britain. After reposing a few weeks at
Madras, the regiment received orders to transfer its services
to Ceylon, and it landed at Columbo, the capital
of the island, in December, 1796.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>General David Graeme died in January, 1797, and
King George III. conferred the colonelcy of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
on Major-General Samuel Hulse, from the fifty-sixth
regiment of foot.</p>

<p>In the island of Ceylon, which produces a great
diversity of vegetables, the finest fruits, and spices of
good quality, particularly cinnamon, the regiment was
stationed twenty-four years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>About this period the officers and soldiers of the
<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment subscribed one day's pay, amounting
to £84, for the relief of the widows and children of
the men killed in the victory obtained by Admiral Lord
Nelson over the French fleet at the battle of the Nile,
on the 1st of August, 1798. The regiment subscribed
also 2500 pagodas (8<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> each) towards carrying on
the war in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>Five companies embarked in February, 1799, for the
continent of India, to take part in the war with the ruler
of the province of <em>Mysore</em>, the celebrated Tippoo Saib,
whose adoption of French counsels, and hostility to the
British interests, proved his ruin. The Mysore was invaded
by the British troops, under Lieut.-General (afterwards
Lord) Harris, in March, 1799, and the army advanced
by triumphant marches to the capital, the strong
and splendid city and fortress of <em>Seringapatam</em>, which was
captured by storm on the 4th of May, when Tippoo
fell, mortally wounded, in the defence of the place.</p>

<p>The capture of the capital having terminated the war
in the Mysore, the five companies of the regiment afterwards
returned to Ceylon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>From Columbo, the regiment marched, in October,
1800, to Point de Galle, where the head-quarters were
stationed several months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>In April, 1801, the regiment embarked for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
harbour, town, and fortress of Trincomalee, situate in
a barren tract of country on the north-east side of the
island of Ceylon, from whence detachments were sent
to various posts in the interior. The centre of the
island appeared to be defended against the approach of
Europeans by the unhealthy climate of the district,
through which it was necessary to pass to enter the
inland provinces, which were governed by a native
chief called the King of Candy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>In 1802 a treaty of peace was concluded between
England and France and Holland; but the island of
Ceylon was retained by the British.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>War with France and Holland was resumed in 1803,
and, at the same time, it was found necessary to commence
hostilities with the Candians, inhabiting the
interior of the island of Ceylon, with whom attempts
had been made to establish a treaty of amity and commerce,
but without success.</p>

<p>Some outrages having been committed by the Candians
on British subjects, demand was made for reparation,
which was evaded on various pretences, and a body of
troops, of which a detachment of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment
formed part, penetrated through the unhealthy
districts into the interior, to demand redress, and to
exact security against the repetition of outrage. The
troops experienced little opposition, and advanced to
<em>Candy</em>, the capital, which was found abandoned by the
inhabitants. A treaty was framed, and everything
appeared in a train for a satisfactory arrangement; but
after evincing unparalleled duplicity and treachery, the
population of the surrounding districts suddenly attacked
the town after hostilities had ceased, and the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
troops, under Major Davey, being overpowered by
numbers, agreed to capitulate, on condition of being
allowed to march with their arms to the British settlements
on the coast. These conditions were violated;
the British soldiers were barbarously massacred, at
Candy, on the 24th of June, excepting a few men who
escaped, or were spared by the assassins; the Malays
in the English service were required to enter the
Candian service, and all who refused were destroyed.
The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment had the following officers
and soldiers massacred on this occasion,&mdash;Lieutenants
M. H. Bynn, Peter Plenderleath, and Hector M'Lean,
Ensign Robert Smith, Quarter-Master John Brown,
Assistant-Surgeon William Hope, and one hundred and
seventy-two non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>

<p>After this act of perfidy and cruelty the Candians
attacked the British settlements, and gained some
temporary advantages; but were eventually driven
back with loss. The surviving officers and soldiers of
the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment were employed in much
harassing and perilous service, and many casualties were
occasioned by the climate. Captain Beaver particularly
distinguished himself, and the governor, Major-General
M<sup>c</sup>Dowall, expressed his sense of the captain's services,
in general orders dated Columbo, 2nd September, 1803,
in the following terms: "The Governor has observed,
with peculiar satisfaction, the rapid series of well-judged
and well-executed operations, by which
Captain <span class="smcap">Herbert Beaver</span>, of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment,
has hitherto proceeded, in recovering the
important province of Matura from the Candians,
and in bringing back its deluded inhabitants to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
duty. The indefatigable activity, zeal, and ability,
which that officer has displayed, since his assumption
of the command in that district, has fully justified
the high opinion which his Excellency had formed of
him from his former services, and which induced the
Governor to appoint him to that arduous station, in
a time of such extreme difficulty and discouragement."
The governor also expressed his approbation of the
conduct of the officers and soldiers serving under
Captain Beaver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>In 1804 the Candians again made preparations for
an attack on the British settlements; and the English
troops penetrated the provinces of Candy. Some sharp
fighting occurred; and on the 14th of October Lieutenants
B. Vincent and H. L. Smith were killed at
Fort M<sup>c</sup>Dowall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>Another attack on the British territory was made in
the early part of 1805; but the Candians were completely
routed in every quarter. In October of this
year the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment embarked for Columbo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded by sea to Trincomalee in
September, 1806; but marched back to Columbo two
months afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1807<br />1808</div>

<p>During the years 1807 and 1808, the regiment was
stationed at the capital of the island of Ceylon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>Disputes of a tedious and complicated character
between the British government and the Rajah of
<em>Travancore</em>, a province situated at the south-west
extremity of Hindoostan, occasioned the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
regiment to be withdrawn from Ceylon in February,
1809, and to proceed to Madras to join the troops
designed for the reduction of the hostile Rajah. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
country of Travancore was taken possession of without
much serious opposition, when a force of sufficient
strength was assembled for that purpose, and the Rajah
was forced to submit. In December the regiment
returned to Ceylon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>General Sir Samuel Hulse having been removed to
the sixty-second regiment, the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
was conferred on Lieut.-General Sir Hew
Dalrymple from the thirty-seventh, by commission
dated the 25th of June, 1810.</p>

<p>The war with France was continued, a British army
was fighting for the liberties of Europe in Portugal and
Spain, and in 1810 the English government resolved to
deprive Napoleon of the Isle of France, now called the
<em>Mauritius</em>, the only remaining territory in the possession
of France, in the East. To take part in this enterprise,
four companies of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment embarked
from Ceylon on the 6th of September, 1810. The
expedition rendezvoused at the island of Rodriguez,
from whence it sailed to the Isle of France, and a
landing was effected on the 29th of November. The
troops suffered much from the want of water in their
advance upon Port Louis, the capital, and finding a
plentiful supply at the powder-mills on the road, they
halted there during the night of the 30th of November.
Some sharp skirmishing occurred, and several men
were killed and wounded. On the following day the
troops resumed their march; drove the French from
their positions with great gallantry; and forced the
governor to surrender this valuable colony in three days.</p>

<p>The four companies afterwards returned to Ceylon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Hew Dalrymple was removed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
April, 1811, to the fifty-seventh regiment, and was
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> by Major-General
Hilgrove Turner, from the Cape regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812<br />1813<br />1814</div>

<p>The reigning sovereign of Candy evinced so cruel and
tyrannical a disposition, that he became odious to his
subjects, who experienced a total insecurity of life and
property under his rule, individuals being frequently
deprived of both at the caprice of the king. The
governor of one of his provinces was summoned to appear
at the capital; but this chief, expecting that the
sacrifice of his life, and the seizure of his property, were
intended, did not obey the mandate. The king
assembled an army, overpowered the forces of the
disobedient chief, and forced him to fly for protection
to the British settlements. About the period when
these events agitated the interior of the island of Ceylon,
the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment embarked for Trincomalee,
where it arrived in the beginning of March, 1814.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Elated with his success against the disobedient chief,
the King of Candy prepared to invade the British territory;
and the governor, Major-General Brownrigg, resolved
to preserve the English provinces from aggression by
invading the kingdom of Candy. The British troops
advanced into the kingdom of Candy, in seven divisions,
in the beginning of February, 1815, and the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>
regiment marched from Trincomalee to take part in
this service. The soldiers underwent great fatigue in
crossing mountains, passing morasses and rivers, and
traversing regions inhabited only by the wild beasts of
the forest; they succeeded in overcoming all opposition,
and arrived at the capital in the middle of February.
The king fled; but he was seized by his own subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ill-treated, and brought a prisoner to the British camp.
An assembly of Candian chiefs declared the Malbar
dynasty deposed, and the provinces of Candy united to
the dominions of the British crown. Thus was an
extensive tract of country, bountifully endowed with
natural gifts, and producing the necessaries and luxuries
of life, including spices, metals, and precious stones,
added to the British dominions; a numerous race of
human beings, of a peculiarly interesting character, was
delivered from the power of despotism, and brought
under the advantages of the just government and
equitable laws of Great Britain. Every species of
torture was immediately abolished; but the ancient
religion of the inhabitants, and the former mode of
administering justice, were preserved. The conduct
of the British troops was highly meritorious, and
reflected credit on the several corps employed on this
enterprise: the soldiers abstained from plunder and
violence, and behaved with such order and regularity
as to conciliate the inhabitants, whose condition, improved
by a policy founded on liberal ideas, and exhibiting
enlarged views, prepared the way for their emancipation
from the errors of superstition, and their introduction
to the advantages of Christianity, and of
European arts, sciences, and commerce.</p>

<p>The British troops occupied posts in the newly-acquired
territory, and the corps not required for this
duty returned to their former quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment remained at Trincomalee,
and other stations in that quarter of the island, until
February, 1818, when it returned to Columbo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>Soon afterwards a new claimant to the throne of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Candy arrived in that country, from the continent of
India, and being supported by several native chiefs, who
were hostile to the British interests, a rebellion took
place. This event called the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> again into the
field; they marched for Candy in April, 1818, and again
traversed mountainous districts and wild and beautiful
regions; some desultory fighting occurred; but a greater
loss of life was occasioned by the climate, than by the
swords of the insurgents. The rebellion was suppressed;
the regiment returned to Columbo in September; and
in October it marched to Point de Galle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>After serving twenty-three years at Ceylon, and
taking a distinguished part in the important events
which had occurred in that island, the regiment was
relieved from duty there, and embarked for England
in January, 1820; it landed at Gravesend on the 19th
of May, and was stationed in the south of England
during the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In February, 1821, the regiment marched to Weedon
Barracks; and in November embarked from Liverpool
for Ireland, and, after landing at Dublin, marched to
Mullingar, Longford, Tullamore, Philipstown, and
Maryborough.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1822<br />1823<br />1824<br />1825<br />1826</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland during the years
1822, 1823, 1824, and 1825; in the autumn of 1826 it
was divided into six service and four depôt companies:
the service companies embarked from Cork in October,
for the island of Demerara, where they arrived in
December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>The depôt companies were stationed in Ireland until
June, 1830, when they embarked from Cork for Portsmouth,
where they arrived in two days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>After occupying various stations in the British West
India Islands, during the period of nearly ten years, the
service companies embarked from Barbadoes in July,
1836, and landed at Cork in August: they were afterwards
joined by the depôt companies from England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1837<br />1838</div>

<p>During the years 1837 and 1838, the regiment was
stationed in Ireland; in December, 1839, it embarked
from Dublin for Bristol; but returned to Ireland in
March following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>In the summer of 1840 the regiment was again
divided into six service, and four depôt companies, and
in September the service companies embarked from
Cork for the island of Malta, where they landed on the
3rd and 13th of October.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1841<br />1842</div>

<p>The depôt companies left Ireland in 1841, and were
stationed a short time at Gosport; they proceeded to
Brighton in March, 1842, and to Dover Castle in
October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>General Sir Hilgrove Turner, G.C.H., K.C., died at
Jersey, in May, 1843, and General Sir Warren Marmaduke
Peacocke, K.C.H. and K.C., was appointed by Her
Majesty Colonel of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment.</p>

<p>The service companies proceeded in the Resistance
troop-ship from Malta to the Ionian Islands on the 9th
of January, 1843, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Hay, and arrived at Corfu on the 20th of the
same month; five days afterwards the head-quarters and
three companies embarked in the Boyne transport for
Cephalonia.</p>

<p>In October, 1843, the depôt companies marched from
Dover to Winchester, and from thence to Portsmouth,
where they embarked for Jersey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1845</div>

<p>On the 18th of June, 1845, the depôt companies embarked
at Jersey for Ireland, and disembarked at Waterford.</p>

<p>On the 5th of December, 1845, the service companies
of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment embarked at Corfu for
the West Indies, in the Java freight-ship, under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Hay.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1846</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Barbadoes on the 19th of
January, 1846.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1847</div>

<p>In February, 1847, the regiment embarked at Barbadoes
for St. Vincent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>The regiment returned to Barbadoes in April, 1848,
and was transhipped on board the Bombay transport on
the 12th of that month, and sailed in a few days for
North America.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, the date to which the record has
been continued, the service companies were stationed at
Montreal, under the command of Major Sanders, and
the depôt companies, under Major Calley, remained in
Ireland, the head-quarters occupying the barracks at
Castlebar.</p>

<p class="noindent">The details narrated in the foregoing pages, contain
accounts of the services of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH REGIMENT
OF FOOT</span>, for a period of one hundred and sixty years,
and although the Regimental colour does not display any
mark of distinction for services performed, yet the record
of the regiment proves, that when opportunity has
offered, the regiment has evinced that zeal and devotion
to its country's cause, and that patient endurance and
bravery in the field, for which every British corps has
been distinguished; these qualities were shown in the
war in Flanders under King William III., particularly
at the battles of <em>Steenkirk</em> and <em>Landen</em>, and at the siege
of <em>Namur</em>, from 1692 to 1695; again in Flanders in
1710 and 1711, with the army under the command of
the Duke of Marlborough. The regiment again distinguished
itself in the war in Flanders, particularly at
the battles of Fontenoy, Roucoux, and Val, in 1745,
1746, and 1747. In 1761, in the attack and capture
of <em>Belle Isle</em>, where nature as well as art had combined
to render the place impregnable, the regiment evinced
an extraordinary degree of bravery. Its services were
again evinced in Flanders, with the army under His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, in 1794 and 1795.</p>

<p>The regiment has also been distinguished by long
and arduous services in the eastern parts of the world
from 1796 to 1820; it was engaged in the storming of
Seringapatam on the 4th of May, 1799, where the celebrated
Tippoo Saib was mortally wounded, and the
city captured. Its services in the conquest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Island of Ceylon and the deposition of the King of
Candy, in 1815, likewise form an important and honorable
era in the records of the regiment; the gallantry of
the troops on this occasion caused the annexation of the
colony of Ceylon to the British dominions, and the conduct
of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment in suppressing the
rebellion in that island, in 1818, secured the possession
of this valuable appendage to the territories of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The services of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment in the
Field, as well as in arduous Colonial duties, have
been such as to show in the foregoing pages, that
the officers and men have ample cause for feelings
of pride in the honor acquired by the corps in whatever
duty it has been employed, and this tribute
of commendation is considered to be justly due to a
regiment, the services of which have been so highly
meritorious during a period of one hundred and sixty
years.</p>

<p class="p1 center smcap">Francis Lutterell.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Appointed 28th February, 1689.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Francis Lutterell</span>, was one of the zealous Protestant
gentlemen who joined the standard of the Prince of Orange,
at the Revolution in 1688, and on the elevation of the Prince
to the throne, in February, 1689, he was nominated Colonel
of a regiment of foot, now the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span>, which was
formed of companies raised in November, 1688. He died
before he attained any higher rank.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Thomas Erle.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Appointed 1st January, 1691.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thomas Erle</span> evinced attachment to the principles of the
Revolution of 1688, and on the 8th of March, 1689, he was
commissioned to raise a regiment of foot for the service of
King William III., which was afterwards disbanded. He
proceeded with his regiment to Ireland in 1689, and proved
an officer of great merit and personal bravery. He served
under King William at the battle of the Boyne, and at the
siege of Limerick in 1690; and greatly distinguished himself
at the battle of Aghrim in 1691, where he was taken prisoner
at the head of his regiment, in attempting to force the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of a bog. He was rescued by his men, and headed another
attack, when he was wounded and again taken prisoner; but
was rescued a second time by his men. He afterwards
served at the siege of Limerick, and being sent to England
with despatches, he was removed by King William to the
<span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment, his commission being dated the 1st of
January, 1691. He was nominated Brigadier-General in 1793,
and served under King William in Flanders; but was obliged
to quit the field from ill health. While confined to his bed
with a fever, at Malines, he heard that a general engagement
was likely to take place, when he rejoined the army, behaved
with great gallantry at the battle of Landen, and was dangerously
wounded. He recovered of his wound, and commanded
a brigade during the campaigns of 1694 and 1695; on the
1st of June, 1696, he was promoted to the rank of Major-General;
and in February, 1703, to that of Lieut.-General.
He was employed on the staff of South Britain, and raised a
regiment of dragoons, the colonelcy of which was afterwards
conferred on Lord Cutts. In 1708, he commanded an
expedition to the coast of France, but nothing of importance
was accomplished; he afterwards proceeded with the infantry
to Ostend, and performed great service in forwarding supplies
to the allied army during the siege of Lisle. In 1709, he
disposed of the colonelcy of his regiment. He was afterwards
nominated Lieut.-General of the Ordnance, and also Commander
of the land forces in South Britain; and in January, 1711, he
was promoted to the rank of General. Political events
occasioned his removal from the appointments of Lieut.-General
of the Ordnance, and Commander in South Britain,
in 1712. He died on the 23rd of July, 1720.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">George Freke.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Appointed 23rd May, 1709.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This officer was appointed Ensign in the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment
on the 19th of April, 1693, and he served in Flanders
under King William III. In 1702, he served in the expedition
to Cadiz, from whence he proceeded to the West
Indies, and was afterwards rewarded with the lieut.-colonelcy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the <span class="fs70">NINETEENTH</span> regiment, the colonelcy of which corps
he obtained by purchase in 1709. He was promoted to the
rank of Brigadier-General on the 12th of February, 1711.
His decease occurred before he attained any higher rank.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Richard Sutton.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Appointed 3rd April, 1712.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Richard Sutton</span> was appointed Ensign in a regiment of
foot, on the 1st of April, 1690, and he served in Ireland, and
also in Flanders, under King William III. He was afterwards
promoted to the majority of the Eighth regiment, with
which he served at the battles of Schellenberg and Blenheim
in 1704; at the forcing of the French lines at Helixem in
1705; and at the battle of Ramilies, in 1706. Being afterwards

In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards

no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that, whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p></div>
